    | Modules Namespace
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This is the PHP namespace that your modules will be created in. For
    | example, a module called "Helpers" will be placed in \Modules\Helpers
    | by default.
    |
    | It is *highly recommended* that you configure this to your organization
    | name to make extracting modules to their own package easier (should you
    | choose to ever do so).
    |
    | If you set the namespace, you should also set the vendor name to match.
    |

    | Composer "Vendor" Name
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This is the prefix used for your composer.json file. This should be the

    | generate the kebab-case version for you).

    | Modules Directory

    |
    | If you want to install modules in a custom directory, you can do so here.
    | Keeping the default `app-modules/` directory is highly recommended,
    | though, as it keeps your modules near the rest of your application code
    | in an alpha-sorted directory listing.

    | stub file. Destination paths and contents support placeholders. See the
    | README.md file for more information.
